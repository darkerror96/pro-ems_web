Real-time Trading System as a Java Web Application using Eclipse as an IDE.

Complex level of a Java Web Application integrated with many well-known Libraries. Used Yahoo's Finance API to update real-time stock price every 20 seconds using Daemon threads.

For all beginners/semi-pro, this is perfect repository to start-off with a java web application describing Trading System in simple manner. I have used phpMyAdmin for managing database. I have added some security features and validations for better conduct of this application. I have used Eclipse 4.9.0 as an IDE.

For testing the application, you have to Register(Sign Up) as a Customer. You will be asked to provide personal details. Once entered details is validated, one can Log In to kick start trading and managing the stocks. I have also added few functionalities for managing the stocks.
