UseCase: - An Employee Management System is designed to simplify the process of record maintenance of employees in an organisation. It helps in managing the information of employees for HR functions. In general, EMS is a part of a comprehensive Human Resource Management System. Most modern companies use computers to collect this information, making their system more accurate and problem-free. A database is often used to collect the information required.

Employee Management System as a Java Web Application using Spring Tool Suite 4 as an IDE.

Complex level of a Java Web Application integrated with well-known library 'mysql-connector-java-8.0.15' to connect to MySQL Database.

For all beginners/semi-pro, this is perfect repository to start-off with a java web application describing Employee Management System in simple manner. I have used MySQL Workbench for managing database. I have added some security features and validations for better conduct of this application. I have used Spring Tool Suite 4 as an IDE.

For testing the application, you have to Login as an Admin. Once login credentials are validated, one can start managing the Employees and Managers. I have also added basic functionalities for managing the Employee viz. Create, Search, Update and Delete Employee. Employee can also login to view his/her details.

NOTE: - MySQL Database is initialized with unreal Employees and Managers Details.
