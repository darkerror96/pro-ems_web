An Employee management system is designed to simplify the process of record maintenance of employees in an organisation. It helps in managing the information of employees for HR functions. In general, employee management system is a part of a comprehensive Human Resource Management System.

An employee management system uses a proven series of methods to gather information about the employees of a business. Most modern companies use computers to collect this information, making their system more accurate and problem-free. A database is often used to collect the information required and records may be sent out to those needing it, such as management, owners, and human resources personnel. The management system for employees often handles administrative tasks that are run by managers or owners of a company. Large organizations may have complex processes for payrolls, evaluation, and selection, so an effective and efficient system is needed to handle this information as quickly as possible. Employee systems should include personal information about each individual, such as their salary, accomplishments, capabilities, skills, and histories. This is also a great method for companies who hire hundreds of workers because it gives them an easy way to keep track of personnel.
